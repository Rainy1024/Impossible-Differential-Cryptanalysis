This is an automatic search model for related-tweakey impossible differential cryptanalysis. In this model, we first introduce the Locality Constraint Analysis (LCA) technique to cryptanalysis and propose a generalized automatic search model. Technically, we convert our models into SMT problems based on SAT solver and apply them to several tweakable block ciphers for evaluating the effectiveness and practicality of our optimized automatic search methods.
